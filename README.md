# ZK-Worm: Zero-Knowledge Integration with Wormhole

## Overview

ZK-Worm is an open-source project that provides a comprehensive resource hub for integrating Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs into the Wormhole protocol. This project aims to enhance privacy and security for cross-chain transactions, allowing developers to implement ZK technology seamlessly.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and resources to assist developers in integrating ZK proofs with Wormhole.
- **SDK Integration**: An SDK that simplifies the implementation of ZK technology in your blockchain applications.
- **Privacy-Preserving Transactions**: Enable secure cross-chain transactions without revealing sensitive data.

## Getting Started

To get started with ZK-Worm, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- A blockchain wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
- Basic knowledge of Zero-Knowledge proofs and the Wormhole protocol

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaitamaCoderVN/ZK-Worm.git
cd zk-worm
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

1. **Generate ZK Proofs**: Utilize the provided tools to create ZK proofs for your transactions.
2. **Integrate with Wormhole**: Use the SDK to facilitate communication between different blockchain networks.
3. **Test Your Implementation**: Deploy your application on a testnet and ensure functionality with privacy features.
